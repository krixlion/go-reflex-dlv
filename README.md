# Go-Reflex-Devel

This is the repo for my [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/krixlion/go-reflex-dlv) that I use for development of microservices in go.

## Environment variables
BUILD_ARGS - file path \
RUN_ARGS - flags for compiled binary \
DEBUG_PORT - port on which Delve server will run \
DELVE_ARGS - additional flags for Delve to run with 

TESTING - if set to `"true"` then delve will launch in debug tests mode and run tests from provided package path \
TEST_PATH - path to the test file

## Mount
Container will read everything from `/app` and that's where you should mount your project root. 

## Examples
